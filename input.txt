I still write only about princes counts ministers senators and their children and I am afraid that there will be no other faces in my history Maybe it is not good and the public does not like it maybe it is more interesting and instructive to the story of men merchants seminarians but with all my desire to have as many readers as possible I can not please this taste for many reasons First of all because the monuments of the history of the time about which I write remained only in correspondence and notes of people of the highest circle of literate even interesting and clever stories that I managed to hear I heard only from people of the same circle Secondly because the life of merchants coachmen seminarians convicts and men seems monotonous and boring to me and all the actions of these people seem to me to follow for the most part from the same springs envy of happier estates greediness and material passions If not all the actions of these people stem from these springs then their actions are so overshadowed by these motives that it is difficult to understand them and therefore to describe them Third because the lives of these people lower classes are less time consuming Fourthly because these peoples lives arent pretty Fifthly because I could never understand what the boothkeeper was thinking standing at the booth what the shopkeeper was thinking and feeling calling to buy piss and ties what the seminarian was thinking when he was led for the hundredth time etc Just as I cant understand it I cant understand what a cow thinks when its milked and what a horse thinks when its driven by a barrel Sixth because finally and this I know is the best reason that I myself belong to the highest class society and love it I am not a bourgeois as Pushkin proudly said and boldly say that I am an aristocrat both by birth and by habit and by position I am an aristocrat because to remember my ancestors  my fathers grandfathers greatgrandfathers I am not only unconscientious but especially joyful I am an aristocrat because I was brought up from childhood in love and respect for the graceful expressed not only in Homer Bach and Raphael but also in all the details of life in love with clean hands a beautiful dress an elegant table and crew I am an aristocrat because I was so happy that neither I nor my father nor my grandfather knew the need and struggle between conscience and need had no need to ever envy or bow did not know the need to be formed for money and for the position in the light and the like trials to which people in need I see that this is a great happiness and I thank God for it but if happiness does not belong to everyone then I see no reason to deny it and not use it I am an aristocrat because I cannot believe in the high mind fine taste and great honesty of a man who picks his nose with his finger and whose soul talks to God Its all very stupid maybe criminal audacious but it is And I go ahead and tell the reader what kind of person I am and what he can expect from me Its still time to close the book and rebuke me as an idiot retrograde and Askochensky who I take this opportunity to express my long felt sincere and deep respect   Well Prince Genoa and Lucca are no more like estates estates of the Buonaparte family No Im telling you first if you dont tell me that we are at war if you allow yourself to defend all the ugly things all the horrors of this Antichrist right I believe that he is Antichrist  I dont know you anymore you are no longer my friend you are no longer my faithful slave as you say Well hello hello hello I can see that Im scaring you sit down and tell you So said in July  the famous Anna Pavlovna Scherer maid of honor and close associate of Empress Maria Feodorovna meeting an important and official Prince Basil the first to arrive at her evening Anna Pavlovna coughed for a few days she had the flu as she said flu was then a new word used only by rare people and therefore she was not on duty and did not leave the house The notes sent out in the morning with the red footman were written without distinction If you Count or Prince have nothing better in mind and if the prospect of the evening at the poor patient does not frighten you too much then I will be very glad to see you today at my place between  and  oclock Anna Scherer  Oh what a brutal attack  He answered not at all embarrassed by such a meeting and smiling weakly the prince who came in with a light expression of a cunning face wearing a court sewed uniform stockings shoes and stars He spoke the exquisite French that our grandfathers not only spoke but also thought and those quiet patronizing intonations that are characteristic of a significant man who has aged in the light and at court He came up to Anna Pavlovna kissed her hand put his scented and shining whiteness even between the gray hair bald and quietly sat down on the sofa  First of all tell me how are you dear friend Calm your friend down he said without changing your voice and in a tone which out of decency and participation enlightened indifference and even mockery  How do you want me to be healthy when youre morally suffering Is it possible to stay calm in our time when a man has a feeling  said Anna Pavlovna Youve been with me all night I hope  And the English Messengers Day Its Wednesday now I have to show up there said the prince  My daughter will pick me up and take me  I thought this holiday was canceled I have to admit all these festivals and fireworks are getting ugly  If you had known you wanted it the feast would have been cancelled said the prince as a habit saying things he did not want to be believed  Dont torment me Well what did you decide on the occasion of Novosiletsevs dispatch Well you all know  How do I put this  said the prince in a cold bored tone What did you decide We decided that Buonaparte had burned his ships and we too seem ready to burn ours Prince Vasily whether he spoke clever or stupid animated or indifferent words spoke them in such a tone as if he repeated them a thousand times as if the actor played the role of an old play as if the words did not come out of his considerations and as if he spoke them not with his mind not with his heart but from memory with his lips alone Anna Pavlovna Scherer on the other hand despite her forty years of life was full of excitement and impulses which she had a long experience barely accustomed herself to contain within the courts deliberation decency and restraint Every minute she was probably ready to say something extra but even though she was a hairs breadth of it it did not break through She wasnt good but apparently her selfawareness of the delight of her gaze and the excitement of her smile which expressed her passion for the perfect interest gave her what was called interest According to the words and expression of Prince Vasily it was clear that in the circle where they both addressed has long established a recognized opinion of Anna Pavlovna as a sweet and good enthusiast and patriot who takes a little bit not for his business and often goes to extremes but nice sincerity and ardor of their feelings To be an enthusiast has become her social status and sometimes when she did not even want to it is not to deceive the expectations of people who knew her was made an enthusiast A restrained smile playing constantly on the face of Anna Pavlovna though not going to her outmoded traits expressed as in spoiled children the constant consciousness of his cute lack from which she does not want can not and does not find the need to correct The content of the dispatch from Novosiletsev who went to Paris to negotiate peace was as follows When he arrived in Berlin Novosiletsev learned that Buonaparte had issued a decree on the annexation of the Republic of Genoa to the French Empire at the same time as he expressed his desire to put up with England through the mediation of Russia Novosibirsk staying in Berlin and assuming that such violence Bouonaparte could change the intention of Emperor Alexander asked His Majestys permission to go to Paris or return The answer to Novosiletsev was already drawn up and should be sent back tomorrow The possession of Genoa was a welcome pretext for declaring war for which the opinion of the court society was even more ready than the army The answer was that We do not want to negotiate with a man who in his desire to be reconciled continues his invasion That was all the latest news of the day The prince apparently knew all these details from the right sources and jokingly passed them on to the maiden  Well what did these negotiations lead us to said Anna Pavlovna in French as the whole conversation went on  Well what was the point of all the negotiations Not negotiations but death for the death of a martyr is necessary to the villain she said inflating her nostrils turning on the sofa and smiling after that  How bloodthirsty you are darling Politics doesnt do everything like in the living room There are precautions said Prince Vasily with his sad smile which was unnatural but repeating itself for thirty years so shackled on the princes old face that it seemed together and unnatural and habitual  Any letters from yours   he added apparently considering the maiden unworthy of serious political conversation and trying to translate it into another subject  But where did these precautions lead us Anna Pavlovna kept asking not yielding to him  And at least to the opinion of Austria which you love so much  said Prince Vasily apparently teasing Anna Pavlovna and not wanting to let the conversation out of a joking tone But Anna Pavlovna got hot  Oh dont tell me about Austria I dont understand anything maybe but Austria has never wanted or wants war It betrays us Russia alone must be the savior of Europe Our benefactor knows his high calling and will be faithful to him Heres one thing I believe in Our good and wonderful sovereign will have the greatest role in the world and he is so virtuous and good that God will not abandon him and he will fulfill his calling to crush the hydrator of the revolution which is now even worse in the face of this murderer and villain We alone must redeem the blood of the righteous Who should we hope for I ask you England with its commercial spirit cannot and will not understand the height of Emperor Alexanders soul She has refused to cleanse Malta She wants to see she seeks the back thought of our actions What did they say to Novosiltsev Nothing They dont understand they cant understand our Emperors selfabsorption who wants nothing for himself and everything for the good of the world And what did they promise Nothing And what they promised and it wont happen Prussia has already declared that Buonaparte is invincible and that all Europe can do nothing against him And I dont believe in a single word neither Gardenberg nor Gaugwitz This notorious neutrality of Prussia is only a trap I believe in one God and in the high fate of our dear emperor He will save Europe She suddenly stopped with a smile of mockery of her hotness  I think said the prince smiling that if you had been sent instead of our dear Wincenberoda you would have taken the Prussian kings consent by storm You are so eloquent Will you give me some tea  Now By the way she added calm down again Im going to have a very interesting man the Vicomte de Mortemar Hes related to Montmorangie through the Rogans one of Frances best names Hes one of the good emigrants the real ones He behaved very well and lost everything He was under the Duke of Engyen the unfortunate holy martyr during his stay in Atenheim They say he was very nice Your charming son Hippolyte promised me to bring him Are all our ladies crazy about not She added with a smile of contempt as if she were sorry for poor ladies who couldnt think of anything better than falling in love with the Viscount de Mortemar  Except for you of course the prince said everything in his laughing tone  I saw him this viscount in the light he added apparently with little interest in the hope of seeing Mortemar  Tell me he said as if he had just remembered something and especially carelessly whereas what he asked was the main purpose of his visit is it true that the Empress Mother wishes Baron Funke to be appointed First Secretary in Vienna This baron seems to be a lowly person Prince Basil wished to define the son on this place which through empress Maria Fiodorovna tried to deliver to the baron Anna Pavlovna almost closed her eyes as a sign that neither she nor anyone else can judge anything that the Empress likes or likes  Baron Funke was recommended to the Empress Mother by her sister only she said in a very special sad dry tone While Anna Pavlovna named the Empress her face suddenly presented a deep and sincere expression of devotion and respect combined with sadness that happened to her every time she mentioned her high patroness She said that her majesty was willing to give Baron Funca a lot of respect and again her gaze turned sad The prince is indifferent to the silence Anna Pavlovna with her peculiar court and female dexterity and quick tact wanted and snapped the prince because he dared to say so about the face recommended to the empress and at the same time to comfort him  Speaking of your family she said do you know that your daughter is the pleasure of the community Shes found beautiful as a day The lady often asks about her What is the beautiful Elena doing The prince bent down as a sign of respect and gratitude  I often think continued Anna Pavlovna after a minute of silence moving towards the prince and smiling affectionately at him as if showing that political and secular conversations are over and now the intimate conversation begins I often think how sometimes the happiness of life is unfairly distributed Why have you been given the fate of such two glorious children except Anatol your younger one I dont love him she insisted without appeal raising her eyebrows such lovely children And you right least of all value them and therefore they are not  And she smiled her enthusiastic smile  What do you want Lafater would say I have no cone of parental love said the prince sluggishly  Stop joking I wanted to have a serious talk with you You know Im not happy with your lesser son I dont know him at all but I think hes made a scandalous reputation for himself Between us be told her face took a sad expression he was spoken of by Her Majesty and they pity you The prince did not answer but she silently much looking at him was waiting for an answer Prince Vasiliy wincered  What do you want me to do  he finally said  You know I did everything my father could to raise them and they both came out foolish Hippolyte is at least a dead fool and Anatole is restless Here is one difference  he said smiling more unnaturally and inanimately than usual and at the same time showing in his mouth wrinkles something so rough and unpleasant that Anna Pavlovna thought it must not be pleasant to be a son or daughter of such a father  And why are babies born to people like you If you werent a father I couldnt reproach you for anything said Anna Pavlovna thoughtfully raising her eyes  Im your faithful slave and I can confess to you alone My children are a burden on my existence This is my cross Thats what Im explaining to myself What do you want He kept silent expressing his submission to a cruel fate Yes if it were possible to have and not have them Im sure this invention will be made in our age Anna Pavlovna did not like the idea of such an invention  Have you ever thought about marrying your prodigal son Anatol They say old ladies have the mania to marry I do not feel this weakness behind me yet but I have a little person who is very unhappy with her father our relative Princess Bolkonskaya Prince Vasily did not answer though with the speed of thought and memory of the head movement peculiar to secular people showed that he accepted this information to the mind  No you know that Anatole costs me  a year he said apparently unable to contain the sadness of his thoughts He didnt say anything  What happens in five years if it goes like this Thats the benefit of being a father Is she rich your princess  Dads very rich and stingy He lives in the village You know this famous prince Bolkonsky retired under the late Emperor and nicknamed the Prussian King Hes a very clever man but with strange things and heavy The poor thing isnt happy She has a brother thats what recently married Lisa Meinen Adjutant Kutuzova lives here and will be with me today She is the only daughter  Listen dear Anette the prince said suddenly taking his companions hand and bending her to a book for some reason  Give me this case and I will be your faithful servant forever Shes a good last name and rich Thats all I need And he with those free and familial graceful movements that distinguished him took the maidens hand kissed her and having kissed her waved the maidens hand falling apart in the chairs and looking to the side  Wait Anna Pavlovna said in her mind Im going to talk to Lisa wife of young Bolkonsky And maybe itll work out Ill start learning the old maidens trade in your familyII Anna Pavlovnas living room started to fill up a bit Came the highest nobility of St Petersburg people most diverse in age and character but the same in society in which all lived came the diplomat Count Z in the stars and orders of all foreign courts Princess L a blossoming beauty the messengers wife a decrepit general a sabre and a quack knocked Prince Basils daughter the beautiful Hlne came in to pick up her father to go with him to the messengers feast She was wearing a cipher and a ball gown She came and is known as the most charming woman of St Petersburg the young little Princess Bolkonskaya last winter married and now did not go to the great light because of his pregnancy but went to small evenings  You have not yet seen or  you do not know my aunt  said Anna Pavlovna to the visiting guests and led them very seriously to the little old lady in high bows who had flown out of the other room as soon as the guests began to arrive called them by name slowly moving her eyes from guest to aunt and then left All the guests performed a rite of greeting to their aunt who was not known to anyone who was not interesting or needed Anna Pavlovna followed their greetings with sad solemn participation silently approving them Auntie spoke to everyone in the same terms about his health his health and the health of Her Majesty which today was thank God better All those who came out of decency without showing any haste with a sense of relief from their heavy duty departed from the old lady so as not to approach her all evening The ten men and ladies present who were at the tea table who were in the corner behind the trellis and who were at the window all spoke and moved freely from one group to another The young Princess Bolkonskaya came to work in a sewn gold velvet bag Her pretty slightly blackened moustache upper sponge was short in the teeth but the nicer she opened and the nicer she sometimes stretched out and fell to the bottom As is always the case with quite attractive women her lack of short lips and halfopen mouth seemed to be her specialty actually her beauty Everybody had fun looking at this healthy and vibrant pretty future mother who was so easy to bear her position To the old and bored young men who looked at her it seemed as if they were making themselves look like her after spending some time talking to her Whoever talked to her and saw a bright smile and shiny white teeth at her every word which were seen incessantly thought that he was especially kind nowadays And thats what everyone thought The little princess overflowing with small quick steps walked around the table with her working handbag on her arm and cheerfully framing her dress sat down on the sofa near the silver samovar as if everything she did was entertainment for her and for all those around her  I took the job she said deploying her reticule and addressing everyone together  Look Anna dont play a bad joke on me she told her mistress You wrote to me that youre having a very small evening you see how Im dressed badly And she waved her hands to show her in lace a gray graceful dress a little below the breasts bandaged in a wide ribbon  Be calm Liz youll all be the best answered Anna Pavlovna You know my husband leaves me he goes to his death She continued in the same tone addressing the general  Tell me what is this ugly war for  She turned to Prince Vasily and without waiting for an answer turned to Prince Vasilys daughter to beautiful Hlne  You know Hlne you are becoming too good too good  What a lovely little princess  said Prince Vasily quietly to Anna Pavlovna  Your charming son Hippolyte is madly in love with her  This fool has taste Shortly after the little princess came in a fat young man with a sheared head glasses light pantaloons in the fashion of the time with high jabot and brown tailcoat This fat young man despite the fashionable cut of the dress was clumsy clumsy as there are awkward and clumsy healthy mens guys But he was shy and determined in his movements For a minute he stopped in the middle of the living room not finding the mistress and bowing to everyone but her despite the signs that she did to him Accepting the old aunt as Anna Pavlovna himself he sat down beside her and began to talk to her but finally learning from his aunts surprised face that this should not be done he stood up and said  Sorry mademoiselle I thought it wasnt you Even her impassioned aunt blushed with these meaningless words and waved with a desperate look to her niece inviting her to help Still busy with another guest Anna Pavlovna approached her  Its very kind of you Monsieur Pierre that you came to see the poor patient she said to him smiling and looking at her aunt Pierre has made it even worse He sat down near Anna Pavlovna with a view of a man who would not be up soon and immediately began with her conversation about Rousseau about which they spoke in the penultimate date Anna Pavlovna didnt have time She listened looked out placed and moved the guests  I cant understand said the young man looking through his glasses at his companion why they dont like Confession while New Eloise is much more insignificant Fat young man was embarrassed to express his thoughts and put Anna Pavlovna in dispute without noticing at all that the maiden and no matter what the work was good or bad and especially now that she had so much to think about and remember  Let the trumpet of the last judgment sound I will stand with my book in my hands he said quoting the first page of Confessions with a smile  If you read this book you will love a man Yes of course  answered Anna Pavlovna despite the fact that she was quite the opposite opinion and looked around the guests wishing to get up But Pierre continued  Its not just a book its an act Its a full confession Isnt it  But I dont want to be his confessor Monsieur Pierre his sins are too ugly she said standing up and smiling  Come on Ill introduce you to my cousin And having got rid of a young man who could not live she returned to her mistress of the house and continued to listen and keep an eye on her ready to give help to the point where the conversation weakened as the owner of the spinning shop having planted workers in the places walks around the establishment and notes whether all spindles are spinning Just as the owner of a spinning mill noticing immobility or an unusual squeaky too loud sound of a spindle hurriedly goes holds it back or lets it in the proper course so Anna Pavlovna came to the silent or too much talking mug and with one word or moving again started an even decent conversation machineIII Anna Pavlovnas evening was started The wind from different sides evenly and not silent noises Except for the aunt near whom sat only one elderly lady with a cried skinny face a few strangers in this brilliant society and besides fat Monsieur Pierre who after his tactless conversations with his aunt and Anna Pavlovna kept silent all evening apparently not familiar almost with anyone and only looked back lively at those who walked and spoke louder than others  society broke into three circles In one center was the beautiful Princess Helen daughter of Prince Vasily in the other  Anna Pavlovna herself in the third  a pretty blushing and too full of youth little Princess Bolkonskaya The son of Prince Vasily Hippolyte your charming son Hippolyte as Anna Pavlovna invariably called him and the expected viscount from which the madness according to Anna Pavlovna all our ladies Hippolyte entered looking at the lorgnette and without omitting the lorgnette drilled loudly but not clearly The Vicomte de Mortemar and immediately paying no attention to his father sat down with the little princess and leaning his head so close to her that there was less than a quarter between her and his face something often and vaguely began to tell her and laugh The viscount was a sweet young man with soft features and tricks who obviously considered himself a celebrity but by virtue of his good manners modestly provided for the society in which he was Anna Pavlovna evidently treated her guests to them As a good maitre dam serves as something supernaturally beautiful that piece of beef which will not want to eat if you see it in the dirty kitchen so this evening Anna Pavlovna served her guests a viscount as something supernaturally refined whereas the gentlemen who stood with him in the same hotel and played with him every day at the pool saw him only as a great master of carambooling and did not find themselves at all happy to see and talk to the Viscount We spoke immediately of the murder of the Duke of Engyen The Vicomte said that the Duke of Engienne died of his generosity and that there were special reasons for the indignation of Buonaparte  Ah Tell us that viscount said Anna Pavlovna The viscount leaned down in submission and smiled politely Anna Pavlovna made a circle near the Viscount and invited everyone to listen to his story  Viscount knew the Duke personally Anna Pavlovna whispered alone  Viscount is an amazing master of storytelling she said to another  As now one can see a man of good society she told the third and the viscount was presented to society in the most elegant and beneficial light like roast beef on a hot dish and sprinkled with greenery Viscount wanted to start his story already and smiled subtly  Come here dear Hlne said Anna Pavlovna to the beautiful princess who sat at a distance forming the center of another circle Princess Hlne was smiling she rose with the same immutable smile of a quite beautiful woman with whom she entered the living room Slightly noisy with her white ballroom robes removed with plush and fur and shiny white shoulders glossy hair and diamonds she walked between the parted men and straight not looking at anyone But smiling and kindly giving everyone the right to admire the beauty of his camp full of shoulders very open on the fashion of the then chest and back and as if bringing with him the glitter of the ball approached Anna Pavlovna Hlne was so good that not only was there no visible shadow of coquetry in her but on the contrary it was as if she was ashamed of her undoubted and too strong and victorious beauty It was as if she wanted and could not diminish her beauty What a beauty Everyone who saw her said As if struck by something extraordinary the viscount shook his shoulders and lowered his eyes while she sat down in front of him and illuminated him with the same constant smile  Madam I am rightly afraid for my abilities in front of such an audience he said with a smile on his head The Princess put her open full hand on the table and did not find anything to say She waited with a smile Throughout the story she sat upright looking occasionally at her full beautiful hand which changed its shape from pressure on the table to even more beautiful breasts on which she corrected the diamond necklace corrected the folds of her dress several times and when the story made an impression looked back at Anna Pavlovna and immediately took the same expression that was on the face of the maiden and then again calmed down in a shining smile After Hlne passed and the little princess from the tea table  Wait Ill take my job she said  What are you thinking about  she turned to Prince Hippolyte  Bring me my reticule The Princess smiling and talking to everyone suddenly made a reshuffle and having sat down merrily recovered  Now I feel good she said and asked me to start and she went to work Prince Hippolyte moved the rediquille to her went after her and having moved the chair close to her sat down beside her The charming Hippolyte was astonished by his extraordinary resemblance to his beautiful sister and even more so by the fact that in spite of his resemblance he was strikingly foolish with himself The features of his face were the same as his sisters but everything was illuminated by the cheerful smug young unchangeable smile of life and the extraordinary beauty of the ancient body his brother on the contrary the same face was darkened by idiocy and invariably expressed selfrighteous grumpiness and the body was skinny and weak The eyes nose and mouth were all clenched as if they were in the same undefined and boring grimaces and the arms and legs always took on unnatural positions  Isnt that a ghost story   he said as he sat down by the princess and hurriedly attached his lorgnette to his eyes as if without this instrument he could not begin to speak  Not at all shrugging his shoulders said the astonished storyteller  The thing is I cant stand ghost stories he said in a tone that was visible he said those words and then he knew what they meant Because of the selfconfidence with which he spoke no one could understand whether what he said was very clever or very stupid He was wearing a dark green tailcoat in the hipcolored pantaloons of a frightened nymph as he himself said in stockings and shoes He sat deep in the chair against the narrator placing one hand with the ring and the seal in front of him on the table in such an elongated position that it seemed to have cost him a great deal of trouble to hold her in that position but throughout the whole story he held his hand like that With the other hand he held a lorgnette in the palm of his hand and with the same hand he adjusted his hairstyle upward which gave an even stranger expression to his elongated face and as if remembering something he began to look at his exposed hand with rings then at the legs of the viscount then all turned quickly and forward as he did everything and for a long time stared at the princess  When I was happy to see for the last time the blessed and sorrowful memory of the Duke of Engyen he began the viscount with graceful sadness in his voice looking back at his listeners speaking in the most flattering terms about the beauty and genius of the great Georges Who doesnt know this brilliant and charming woman I expressed my surprise how the Duke could have recognized her without being in Paris these past years The Duke smiled and told me that Paris is not as far from Mannheim as it seems I was horrified and expressed my fear to his highness when he thought of visiting Paris The sir I said God knows if we are not surrounded here by traitors and traitors and if your presence in Paris however secretly it may be is known to Buonaparte But the Duke only smiled at my words with the chivalry and bravery that make up his name HomeConde a branch of laurel grafted to a Bourbon tree as Pitt recently said  said monotonously Prince Vasily as if he were dictating to some invisible scribe  Mr Pitt expressed himself very well Hippolyte his son succinctly added turning firmly on the chair with his torso in one direction and his legs in the opposite direction hurryingly catching the lorgnette and rushing his gaze at the parent through it  In a word continued the viscount referring mainly to the beautiful princess who had kept an eye on him I had to leave Ethenheim and found out afterwards that the Duke fascinated by his courage had gone to Paris and had honoured Mademoiselle Georges not only by admiring her but by visiting her as well  But he had a heartfelt attachment to Princess Charlotte de Rogan Rochefort  It was said that he was secretly married to her she said apparently frightened by the future content of the story which she thought too free in the presence of a young girl  One affection does not interfere with the other continued the viscount smiling subtly and without noticing Anna Pavlovnas fears  But the fact is that Mademoiselle Georges used to take advantage of being close to the Duke before she became close to another person He didnt say anything  The mans name was Buonaparte he said with a smile as he looked at the audience Anna Pavlovna in turn looked back restlessly seeing that the story is becoming more dangerous and dangerous  The new sultan of the Thousand and One Nights did not neglect to spend his evenings with the most beautiful most pleasant woman in France And Mademoiselle Georges  he shrugged his shoulders expressively  should have turned necessity into virtue The lucky Boonaparte came usually in the evenings without appointing his days  Ah I foresee and I get creepy shaking full and flexible shoulders said the pretty little princess An old lady who had been sitting near her aunt all evening went to the storytellers mug shaking her head and smiling considerably and sadly  Thats terrible isnt it  she said though she obviously hasnt heard the beginning of the story The inappropriateness of her remarks and nobody paid attention to her Prince Hippolyte announced quickly and loudly  Georges as Clytemnestra is amazing Anna Pavlovna was silent and restless not having decided yet definitively in her mind it was decent or indecent what the Viscount was telling On the one hand  evening visits to the actresses on the other hand  if the Vicomte de Mortemar a relative of Montmorency through Roganov the best representative of St Germains suburb in the living room will talk indecent  One evening continued the viscount looking at the hearers and reviving Clytemnestra charming the whole theater with her astonishing transmission of Racine returned home and thought to rest from fatigue and excitement She was not waiting for the sultan Anna Pavlovna shuddered at the word sultan The Princess put her eyes down and stopped smiling  Suddenly the maid reports that a former Viscount Rockroy wants to see a great actress Rokroy  thats what the Duke called himself He was accepted he added a viscount and kept silent for a few seconds to make it clear that he did not tell everything he knew continued  The table shone with crystal enamel silver and porcelain There were two appliances standing time flew by and pleasure Unexpectedly in this place of the story Prince Hippolyte made a strange loud sound which some took as a cough others as a snort mooing or laughing and began to hurry to catch the lost lorgnette The narrator surprisingly stopped Anna Pavlovna frightenedly interrupted the description of the pleasures that the viscount described with such taste  Dont bore us Viscount she said The viscount smiled  Pleasure turned the clock into minutes when suddenly the bell rang and the frightened maid shivering ran into the doorway  Beautiful whispered the little princess sticking a needle into her work as if she were a sign that the interest and beauty of history were preventing her from continuing Viscount appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefully wanted to continue when a new face entered the living room and made the necessary stopIV The new face was the young prince Andrew Bolkonsky husband of the little princess Not so much by the fact that the young prince arrived so late but still was received by the hostess in the most gracious way but the way he entered the room it was seen that he was one of those secular young men who are so spoilt with light that even despise it The young prince was of small stature a very handsome dry brunette with a slightly emaciated look brown complexion in extremely elegant clothes and with tiny arms and legs Everything in his figure from the tired bored look to the lazy and weak gait represented the sharpest contrast with his little lively wife Not only did he seem to know everyone in the living room but he was tired of looking at them and listening to them in such a way that he was very bored because he knew all that would happen Of all the faces that bore him his pretty wifes face seemed to be the most boring With sourness weak makeup which spoiled his beautiful face he turned away from her as if he thought Youre just not enough to make this whole company completely annoy me He kissed Anna Pavlovnas hand as if God knew what to give to get rid of this heavy duty and squinting almost closing his eyes and wrinkling looked around the whole society  You have a convention he said in a small voice and nodded his head at someone setting his hand up for a shake  Are you going to war prince  said Anna Pavlovna  General Kutuzov he said hitting the last syllable of the call like a Frenchman taking off a glove from his white tiny hand and rubbing it in his eyes General Kutuzov calls me to his aides  And Lisa your wife  Shes going to the village  How can you not deprive us of your lovely wife The young aide made a contemptuous sound with his lips protruding as only the French do and did not answer anything  Andrei his wife said addressing her husband in the same flirty tone as she addressed outsiders come here sit down listen to the story the viscount tells of Mademoiselle Georges and Buonaparte Andrew squeezed himself up and sat down in a completely different direction as if he hadnt heard his wife  Go on Viscount said Anna Pavlovna  The viscount told us how the Duke of Engyen was at Mademoiselle Georges she added addressing the man who came in so that he could follow the continuation of the story The imaginary rivalry between Buonaparte and the Duke over Georges said Prince Andrei in a tone as if it were ridiculous for anyone not to know about it and fell on the chair handle At this time a young man wearing glasses called Monsieur Pierre who had not let go of his cheerful friendly eyes since Prince Andrew entered the living room came up to him and took his hand Prince Andrew was so little curious that without looking back wrinkled in front of his face in a makeup that expressed annoyance at the one who touched him but seeing the smiling face of Pierre smiled too and suddenly all his face was transformed A kind and intelligent expression suddenly appeared on him  How Are you here my dear cavalier  asked the prince joyfully but with a patronizing and haughty tint  I knew you would Pierre answered  Ill come to your place for dinner he added quietly so as not to disturb the Viscount who continued his story  May I  No you cant said Prince Andrei laughing and turning away but shaking hands and letting Pierre know that it wasnt necessary to ask The Vicomte told us how Mademoiselle Georges begged the Duke to hide as the Duke said he had never hid before anyone as Mademoiselle Georges told him Your Highness your sword belongs to the King and to France and how the Duke hid under his underwear in another room and how Napoleon was ill and the Duke came out from under his underwear and saw Buonaparte before him  Beautiful delightful  was heard between listeners Even Anna Pavlovna having noticed that the most difficult place of history has passed safely and having calmed down quite could enjoy the story Viscount burst into flames and grading spoke with the inspiration of the actor   The enemy of his house the captor of the throne the one who led his nation was here in front of him motionless on the ground and maybe with his last breath As the great Cornel said Evil joy rose in his heart and only the offended greatness helped him not to give in to it Viscount stopped and coming down to tell his story even stronger smiled as if calming ladies who were already too excited Absolutely unexpectedly during this pause the beautiful Princess Helen looked at her watch glanced with her father and stood up with him and with this movement upset the circle and interrupted the story  Were gonna be late Dad she just said keeping her smile shining on everyone  Excuse me my dear viscount Prince Vasilius turned to the French gently pulling his sleeve down to the chair so he wouldnt get up This unfortunate holiday at the messengers deprives me of pleasure and interrupts you Im very sad to leave your delightful evening  he told Anna Pavlovna His daughter Princess Hlne slightly holding the fold of her dress walked between the chairs and the smile shone even brighter on her beautiful faceV Anna Pavlovna asked the Viscount to wait for her and went to escort Prince Vasily and his daughter to another room An elderly lady who had previously sat with her aunt and then expressed such a silly interest in the history of the Viscount hastily got up and caught up with Prince Vasily in the front All the old pretenses of interest disappeared from her face Her kind crying face expressed only anxiety and fear  What will you tell me Prince about my Boris  she said as she caught up with him in the front she said the name Boris with a special emphasis on o I cant stay in St Petersburg any longer Tell me what news can I bring to my poor boy Despite the fact that Prince Vasily listened reluctantly and almost impolitely to the old lady and even showed impatience she gently and touchingly smiled at him and in order not to leave took his hand  That you should say a word to the sovereign and he will be directly transferred to the guard she asked  Believe that I will do my best Princess Prince Vasily answered but it is difficult for me to ask the sovereign I would advise you to address Razumovsky through Prince Golitsyn it would be smarter An old lady bore the name of Princess Drubetskaya one of the best surnames in Russia but she was poor had long been out of the world and had lost her previous connections She came now to spit out a definition for her only son in the Guards Only then to see Prince Vasily she named herself and came to Anna Pavlovna for the evening only then she listened to the history of the Viscount She was frightened by Prince Vasilys words once her beautiful face expressed almost contempt but it lasted only a minute She smiled again and grabbed hold of Prince Vasilys hand more firmly  Look Prince she said I never asked you never will never will I ever remind you of my fathers friendship with you But now I spell you by God do it for my son and I will consider you a benefactor she hurriedly added  No youre not mad and you promise me I asked Golitsyn he said no Be a kind man as you always were she said trying to smile while there were tears in her eyes  Dad were going to be late said Princess Hlne who was waiting at the door turning her beautiful head on ancient shoulders But influence in light is capital that must be protected so that it does not disappear Prince Vasily knew this and once he had reasoned that if he had started to ask for everyone who asked him he would soon have been unable to ask for anyone he rarely used his influence In the case of Princess Drubetskaya however he felt after her new call something like a shortening of conscience She reminded him of the truth the first steps in his service he was obliged to her father In addition he saw from her methods that she was one of those women especially mothers who once took something in their heads will not stop until they fulfill their desires and otherwise ready for daily every minute of the molestation and even on stage This last consideration shook him  Dear Anna Mikhailovna he said with his usual familiarity and boredom in his voice it is almost impossible for me to do what you want but to prove to you how much I love you and honor the memory of the late Earl your father I will do the impossible Your son will be transferred to the Guard and here is my hand Are you satisfied And he shook her hand pulling her down My darling you are a benefactor I didnt expect anything else from you my mother lied and humiliated me I knew how kind you were He wanted out  Wait two words If he moves into the guard  its jammed Youre good with Mikhail Illarionovich Kutuzov recommend Boris to him as an adjutant Then Id be dead and then Anna Mikhailovna like a gypsy asked for her son the more she was given Prince Vasily smiled  I cant promise that You dont know how Kutuzov has been besieged since he was appointed commanderinchief He told me himself that all the ladies in Moscow conspired to give him all their children as aides  No promise I wont let you my dear my benefactor  Dad were gonna be late again  Well goodbye You see  So tomorrow youll report to the sovereign Sure and I cant promise Kutuzov  No promise promise Vasiliy  Anna Mikhailovna said to him with a smile of a young coquette which once must have been characteristic of her and now it did not go like that to her exhausted kind face She must have forgotten her years and used to use all the old womens remedies But as soon as he came out her face again took the same cold pretended expression that had been on him before She returned to the mug in which the viscount continued to tell and again pretended to listen waiting for time to leave as her work was doneVI The end of the Viscounts history was next The Duke of Engyen took out of his pocket a bottle of rock crystal dressed in gold in which there were life drops given to his father by the Count SaintGermain These drops as we know had the property to revive the dead or almost dead but they should not have been given to anyone except members of the house Konde Outsiders who tasted the drops were healed in the same way as Cond but were made irreconcilable enemies of the ducal house Proof of this is that the father of the Duke who wanted to heal the dying horse gave him these drops The horse came to life but then attempted to kill the saddle several times and once carried him during the battle in the camp of the Republicans The Dukes father killed his favorite horse Despite the fact that the young and knightly Duke of Engyen poured a few drops into the mouth of his enemy Buonaparte and the monster came to life  Who are you  asked Buonaparte  A relative of the maid the Duke answered  Lies Shouting out to Buonaparte  General I am unarmed answered the Duke  Your name I saved your life  answered the Duke The Duke left and the drops worked and Buonaparte felt hatred for the Duke and from that day on swore to destroy the poor and generous young man Through his clevrette learning from the shawl forgotten by the Duke on which was embroidered the coat of arms of the house Conde who was his rival Buonaparte ordered to invent a pretext for conspiracy Pishegrew and Georges Cadudal captured in the Duchy of Baden a martyr hero and killed him  Angel and demon And thats how the worst crime in history was committed With this the viscount made his story and from the excess excitement turned over on the chair Everybody was silent Murdering the Duke was more than a crime Viscount  said Prince Andrew smiling a little as if he was laughing at the Viscount  it was a mistake The viscount raised his eyebrows and spread his arms His gesture could have meant a lot  But how do you find all this latest anointing comedy from Milan  said Anna Pavlovna  And heres a new comedy the peoples of Genoa and Lucca express their wishes to Mr Buonaparte And Mr Buonaparte sits on the throne and grants the wishes of the peoples Oh thats delightful No it makes you crazy Youd think the whole world had lost its head Prince Andrew turned away from Anna Pavlovna as if in the thought that these conversations lead nowhere  God gave me a crown Trouble to him who touches it said Prince Andrew proudly as if it were his words Napoleons words when laying the crown  He was said to have been very good at saying those words he added Anna Pavlovna took a strict look at Prince Andrey  I hope she continued that it was finally the drop that would fill the glass The sovereigns can no longer tolerate this man who threatens everything  The sovereigns I do not speak of Russia  said the viscount politely and hopelessly  Sovereigns But what have they done for Louis XVI for the Queen for Elizabeth Nothing  he continued in his spirit  And believe me they are punished for their treason against the Bourbons The sovereigns They send ambassadors to welcome the captor of the throne And he took a despicable breath and changed his position again Prince Hippolyte who had long looked at the viscount in the lorgnette suddenly turned his whole body to the little princess and asking her for a needle began to show her drawing a needle on the table the coat of arms Konde He interpreted this coat of arms to her with such a significant view as if the princess had asked him to do so Condes coat of arms represents a shield with red and blue narrow jagged stripes he said The Princess was smiling and listening  If Buonaparte stays on the throne of France for another year the viscount continued with the appearance of a man who does not listen to others but in a case best known to him who only follows his thoughts then things will go too far with intrigue violence exile and execution Society I understand good society French society will be destroyed forever and then He shrugged his shoulders and spread his arms  The Emperor Alexander said Anna Pavlovna with sadness that always accompanied her speeches about the imperial family announced that he would let the French themselves choose the image of government And I think there is no doubt that the whole nation having freed itself from the usurper will throw itself into the hands of the rightful king said Anna Pavlovna trying to be kinder to an emigrant and a royalist  Oh if this happy moment could come  said the viscount tilting his head with gratitude for attention  What do you think Mr Pierre  asked Anna Pavlovna affectionately from a fat young man who was weighed down by her awkward silence as a kind mistress  What do you think Youre new from Paris Anna Pavlovna waiting for an answer smiled at the Viscount and others as if to say I must be nice to him too you see I address him too though I know that he can not say anythingVII  The whole nation will die for its emperor for the greatest man in the world  Suddenly without any preparation a young man like a man spoke loudly and passionately looking as if he was afraid that he would be killed and that he would not be able to say anything after the event He looked back at Prince Andrew Prince Andrei smiled  The greatest genius of our century Pierre continued  How Is that your opinion You gotta be kidding me  Anna Pavlovna cried out with fright which came not so much from the words spoken by the young man as from the inspiration not of the living room and completely indecent which was expressed in the large and fleshy features of the young man and mainly in the sound of his voice which was too loud and most importantly natural He did not make gestures spoke intermittently occasionally correcting his glasses and looking back but the whole figure showed that now he would not stop and that he would express all his thoughts without thinking about decency The young man looked like a wild unrideable horse which as long as it is not in the saddle and clamp humble even shy and no different from other horses but which as soon as it is put on the harness suddenly begins to bend its head for no apparent reason wriggle and most ridiculously goat which itself is not happy The young man must have smelled the harness and started his funny goats  Nobody thinks about Bourbons in France anymore he continued hurrying not to be interrupted and constantly looking at Prince Andrew as if he was the only one waiting for support  Dont forget its only three months since I came from Paris He spoke excellent French  Mr Viscount rightly thinks itll be too late for the Bourbons in a year And now its too late The Royalists are gone Some have abandoned their homeland others have become bonapartists The entire SaintGermain suburb worships the Emperor  There are exceptions said the viscount condescendingly The secular familiar Anna Pavlovna was anxiously looking at the Viscount and the indecent young man and could not forgive herself for recklessly inviting this young man without recognizing him before The unseemly young man was the illegitimate son of a famous rich man and nobleman Anna Pavlovna invited him out of respect for his father and taking into account that this Monsieur Pierre had just arrived from abroad where he was brought up If Id known he was so badly brought up and a bonapartist she thought looking at his big haircut head and fleshy big features Thats the kind of upbringing young people get now she thought  You can see a man of good society at once she said to herself admiring the calm of the Viscount  Almost all the nobility Pierre continued has passed to Bo  Thats what the Bonapartists say said the Viscount  Its hard to know French public opinion now  According to Bonaparte said Prince Andrew and unwittingly everyone turned to his quiet lazy but always audible voice waiting to hear what Bonaparte said  I showed them the way of glory they did not want to continued Prince Andrew after a short silence repeating Napoleons words again I opened my forerunners to them they rushed in a crowd I do not know to what extent he had the right to say so but it is evil very evil he concluded with a sour smile and turned away  He had the right to say it against the royalist aristocracy it is no longer in France Pierre picked up and if it is it has no weight And the people The people adore a great man and the people chose him The people have no prejudice they have seen the genius and hero of the greatest in the world  If for some he was a hero said the Vicomte not answering the young man and not even looking at him but addressing Anna Pavlovna and Prince Andrew then after the Duke was killed one martyr became more in heaven one less hero on earth He had time to assess Anna Pavlovna and others these words of the Viscount as an untravelled horse has already continued its funny and unusual goats  The execution of the Duke of Engyen Pierre continued was a state necessity and I see the greatness of my soul in the fact that Napoleon was not afraid to take sole responsibility in this act  You approve of murder Anna Pavlovna spoke in a terrible whisper  How Monsieur Pierre you see in murder the greatness of the soul said the little princess smiling and bringing work to you Ah Oh Say different voices  Perfect suddenly Prince Hippolyte spoke English and started hitting himself on the knee with his palm The viscount only shrugged his shoulders  Is it a good thing or a bad thing to kill the Duke  he said surprising everyone with his high tone of cold blood  One of two Pierre felt that this dilemma was offered to him in such a way that he would be forced to renounce his admiration for the hero answer positively that the action is good God knows what will happen to him He answered affirmatively not afraid of what will happen  This deed is great as is all that this great man does he said desperately and did not pay attention to the horror expressed in all faces except Prince Andrews and to the contemptuous shrugs of his shoulders he continued to speak alone against the apparent reluctance of his mistress Everyone except Prince Andrew listened to him looking at him in astonishment Prince Andrew listened with participation and a quiet smile  Didnt he know Pierre continued the storm that will rise against him for the death of the Duke He knew that he would have to fight all of Europe again for that one head and he would fight and be victorious again because  Are you Russian  Anna Pavlovna asked  Russian But hell win because hes a great man The Dukes death was necessary Hes a genius and hes a genius thats different from ordinary people not for himself but for humanity The Royalists wanted to ignite again the internal war and the revolution he had suppressed He needed inner peace and he showed the Dukes execution such an example that the Bourbons were no longer intriguing  But my dear Monsieur Pierre said Anna Pavlovna trying to take by meekness what do you call the intrigues of the means to return to the rightful throne  Only the will of the people is legal he answered and she banished the Bourbons and gave power to the great Napoleon And he solemnly looked over the glasses at the audience  Ah Social pact said the viscount quietly apparently calming down and recognizing the source from which the enemys arguments were drawn  And after that  exclaimed Anna Pavlovna But even after that Pierre continued his speech just as disrespectfully  No he said more and more animated the Bourbons and royalists fled the revolution they could not understand it And this man became taller than her suppressed her abuses kept all the good things  and the equality of citizens and freedom of speech and press and only because of this he gained power  Yes if he had taken power and given it to the rightful king said the viscount ironically then I would have called him a great man  He couldnt have done it The people gave him power only to get rid of the Bourbons and because the people saw him as a great man The revolution itself was a great thing continued Monsieur Pierre showing with this desperate and provocative introductory sentence his great youth and his desire to express everything as soon as possible  The revolution and the kingship is a great thing After that  Im not talking about the kingship When Napoleon appeared the revolution had already made its time and the nation had given itself to him But he understood the revolution and became its representative  Yeah the ideas of robbery murder and kingship were ironically interrupted again  They were extremes of course but they were not all meanings but meanings in human rights in emancipation from prejudice in equality of citizens and Napoleon kept all these ideas in all their power  Liberty and equality said the viscount contemptuously as if he had finally decided to seriously prove to this young man all the stupidity of his speeches all the loud words that had long been compromised Who does not love freedom and equality Our Savior also preached freedom and equality Did people become happier after the revolution On the contrary We wanted freedom and Buonaparte is destroying it Prince Andrew looked with a cheerful smile at Monsieur Pierre the Viscount the hostess and apparently comforted himself with this unexpected and indecent episode In the first minute of Pierres antics Anna Pavlovna was horrified despite her habit of light but when she saw that despite the sacrilegious speeches made by Pierre the Viscount did not go out of his mind and when she was convinced that these speeches can no longer be hushed up she gathered her strength and joining the Viscount attacked the speaker  But dear Monsieur Pierre said Anna Pavlovna how do you explain the great man who could have executed the Duke finally just a man without trial and without guilt  I would ask said the viscount how Mr Pierre explains the  bruemers Isnt that cheating Its cheating not at all like a great mans way of acting  And the prisoners in Africa that he killed  Thats what the little princess said Thats terrible  And she shrugged her shoulders Its a passerby whatever you say  said Prince Hippolyte Monsieur Pierre did not know who to answer looked around smiled and opened the wrong black teeth with a smile His smile was not the same as that of other people merging with the smile On the contrary when a smile came he suddenly had a serious and even somewhat gloomy face but there was another childish kind even silly and as if begging forgiveness To the Viscount who saw him for the first time it became clear that this Jacobite was not as scary as his words Everyone was silent  How do you want him to answer all of a sudden  Prince Andreis voice echoed  And you have to distinguish between the actions of a private citizen and a military leader or emperor It seems to me that way  Yes yes of course  picked up Pierre happy you  As a man hes great on Arkolsky Bridge in a hospital in Jaffa where he gives a plagues hand but Prince Andrew apparently who wanted to soften the embarrassment of Pierres speech rose up getting off to go and giving a sign to his wife  Its hard to judge he said modern humans our descendants will appreciate it Suddenly Prince Hippolyte stood up and with the signs of his hands stopped everyone and asked to sit down he spoke  Today I was told a lovely Moscow anecdote You should be honored by them Im sorry Viscount Im going to speak Russian otherwise all the salt of the anecdote will disappear And Prince Hippolyte began to speak Russian in such a reprimand as the French say who spent a year in Russia All have stopped so animated Prince Hippolyte urged attention to the history  Theres a lady in Moscou And shes very stingy She needed to have two footmen per carriage And shes very tall That was her taste And she had a maid that was even taller She said Here Prince Hippolyte must have been thinking hard  She said yes she did Girl put on a livery and follow me behind my carriage make visits Here Prince Hippolyte snorted and laughed much before his listeners which made an unfavorable impression on the narrator However many including the old lady and Anna Pavlovna smiled She went Suddenly there was a strong wind The girl lost her hat and her hair was combing long Here he couldnt hold on any longer and began to laugh abruptly and spoke through that laugh  And the whole world knew Thats the end of the joke Although it was not clear why he was telling it and why it was necessary to tell it necessarily in Russian but Anna Pavlovna and others appreciated the secular courtesy of Prince Hippolyte so pleasantly ended the unpleasant and disrespectful prank of Monsieur Pierre The conversation after the anecdote was scattered on small insignificant points about the future and the past ball the performance about when and where anyone will seeVIII Thanking Anna Pavlovna for her lovely evening the guests began to disperse Pierre was clumsy Fat wide with huge hands that seemed to have been created in order to turn the guns he as they say did not know how to enter the salon and even less able to get out of it that is before leaving to bow to say something particularly pleasant Besides he was distracted Getting up he took a triangular hat with a generals plume instead of his hat and held it pulling the sultan until the general as Pierre seemed to be angry asked to return it But all his distraction and inability to enter the salon and speak in it were redeemed with such an expression of complacency and simplicity that despite all its shortcomings he was unwittingly sympathetic even to those who were brought into an embarrassing position Anna Pavlovna turned to him and with Christian meekness expressing forgiveness for his prank nodded at him and said  I hope to see you again but I hope youll change your mind too my dear Monsieur Pierre When she told him this he didnt answer anything he just leaned over and showed everyone again his smile which said nothing except this Opinions and you see what a kind and glorious little man I am And all and Anna Pavlovna unwittingly felt it  You know my dear your reasoning can cause glass to burst Prince Andrew said fastening his sword  They cant said Pierre putting his head down and looking through his glasses and stopping  How can you see nothing in the revolution or in Napoleon but the Bourbons personal interests We dont feel how much we owe the revolution Prince Andrew would not listen to the continuation of this speech He went out to the front and having put his shoulders on the footman who threw his cloak on him indifferently listened to the chatter of his wife with Prince Hippolyte who went out also to the front Prince Hippolyte stood beside the pretty pregnant princess stubbornly looking straight at her in the lorgnette  Go on Anette youll catch a cold said the little princess saying goodbye to Anna Pavlovna  Its been decided she added quietly Anna Pavlovna has already had time to talk to Lisa about the alleged marriage of Anatoly with her daughterinlaw and asked the Princess to act on her husband I hope for you my dear friend  said Anna Pavlovna quietly too you will write to her and tell me how my father will look at the case Goodbye  and she left the front Prince Hippolyte came up to the little princess and leaning close to her face began to whisper something to her Two footmen one princess and the other waiting for them to finish speaking stood with a shawl and a redingote and listened to them incomprehensible to them French speaking to such faces as if they understood what was being said but did not want to show it The Princess as always spoke smiling and listening laughing  Im very glad I didnt go to the messenger Prince Hippolyte said boredom Beautiful evening Isnt it beautiful  They say the ball will be very good answered the princess shaking her sponge with a moustache  All the beautiful women in society will be there  Not all because you will not be there not all said Prince Hippolyte laughing joyfully and grabbed the shawl from the footman even pushed him and began to put it on the princess Because of embarrassment or wilfulness no one would have been able to make it out he did not give up his hands for long when the shawl was already worn and as if hugging a young woman She was graceful but all smiling pulled away turned around and looked at her husband Prince Andrews eyes were closed so he seemed tired and sleepy  Are you ready  he asked his wife looking around her Prince Hippolyte hurriedly put on his redingot which was longer than his heels and confused in it ran to the porch to get the princess which the footman had planted in the carriage Duchess goodbye He shouted confused with his tongue as well as his legs The Princess picking up her dress sat in the darkness of the carriage her husband was riding a sabre Prince Hippolyte under the pretext of service disturbed everyone Paazvolte sir  addressed Prince Andrew in Russian to Prince Hippolyte who prevented him from passing This paazvolte sir sounded so cold disdain that Prince Hippolyte moved extremely quickly began to apologize and nervously pumped from foot to foot as if from a fresh not cooled burning pain Im waiting for you Pierre I heard the voice of Prince Andrew The photographer touched it and the carriage went on wheels Prince Hippolyte laughed abruptly standing on the porch waiting for the Viscount whom he promised to take home  Well my dear your little princess is very sweet very sweet said the viscount sitting in the carriage with Hippolyte He kissed his fingertips  And the perfect Frenchwoman Hippolyte snorting laughing You know youre terrible with your innocent look  continued the viscount  I pity the poor husband the poor officer whos mocking the lordly person Hippolyte snorted a sniffle and talked through the laughter  And you said that Russian ladies are worse than French ladies We need to be able to do thisIX Pierre coming forward as a domestic man went into the office of Prince Andrei and immediately as a habit lay down on the sofa took the first book caught from the shelf these were Caesars Notes and began leaning around reading them from the middle with such interest as if he had been reading them for two hours Prince Andrew having arrived went straight to the restroom and in five minutes went out into the study  What did you do to Mrs Scherer Shes going to be very sick now he said in Russian entering Pierre in a velvet room coat and patronizingly cheerfully and amicably smiling and rubbing the little white hands he must have washed again Pierre turned his whole body so that the couch creaked and wrapped a busy face to Prince Andrei shaking his head It was Pierres fault that he nodded  I only woke up at  Can you imagine that the five of us had eleven bottles Pierre told Prince Andrei and you told him It was so established between them as a child and has not changed  Great people What an Englishman a miracle  I never understood the pleasure Prince Andrew said  No way Youre a very different and amazing person in everything Pierre said frankly  Sweet Anatol Curagin again Yeah Hunting you with that shit  No right hes a nice kid  Crap  Prince Andrew briefly said and frowned Hippolytes a very clever boy isnt he  he added Pierre laughed shaking all his heavy body so that the couch creaked again  There was a lady at Moscou he repeated through the laughter You know hes right the good boy the prince interceded  Well have you finally decided to do something Will you be a cavalier or a diplomat Pierre sat down on the sofa with his legs pressed under his feet  You can imagine I still dont know I dont like either of them  But we have to make up our minds about something right Your fathers waiting From the age of ten Pierre was sent abroad with a governorabbot where he stayed until he was twenty When he returned to Moscow his father let the abbot go and told the young man Now you go to St Petersburg look around make acquaintances and think about choosing the road I will do anything Heres a letter to Prince Vasily and heres your money Write about everything Ill help you in everything Pierre has been choosing his career for three months and hasnt done anything Prince Andrei told him about this choice Pierre rubbed his forehead  I understand military service but tell me this he said  Why do you  you understand everything  why do you go to this war against whom Against Napoleon and France If this were a war for freedom Id understand Id be the first to go into military service but to help England and Austria against the greatest man in the world I dont understand how do you go  You see my dear Prince Andrew began maybe unwittingly wanting to hide a vagueness of thought for himself and suddenly starting in French and changing his former sincere tone to a living room and a cold one you can look at the matter from a completely different point of view And he as if everything they were talking about was his own business or that of people close to him outlined to Pierre a view of the political purpose of Russia in Europe at that time which was then in the highest circles of St Petersburg society Europe has suffered from wars since the revolution The reason for the wars apart from Napoleons ambition was the wrong European balance It was necessary for one great power to take up the cause frankly and impartially and by forming an alliance to draw up new borders for the states and establish a new European balance and a new popular law by virtue of which war would be impossible and all misunderstandings between states would be solved through mediation This selfless role was assumed by Russia in the coming war Russia would only seek to return France to the borders of  giving the French themselves the choice of government as well as the restoration of independence of Italy the Kingdom of Cisalpius the new state of two Belgium the new German Union and even the restoration of Poland Pierre listened attentively several times trying to enter into an argument but held out of respect for his friend  You see were not as stupid as we look this time  concluded Prince Andrew  Yeah yeah but why isnt this plan offered to Napoleon himself  interrupted by Pierre  Hed be the first to accept it if the plan was sincere hed understand and love a great thought Prince Andrew was silent and rubbed his forehead with his little pen  Besides Im going  He stopped  Im going because the life I lead here this life is not for me  Why  Pierre asked surprisingly  Prince Andrei said to the Viscount and Hippolyte that it is proper for me to sneak around the living rooms and pick up nonsense and tell stories about Mademoiselle Georges and the girl Ive had enough of it he added Pierre expressed his agreement  But heres another thing Whats Kutuzov And whats being an aide  Pierre asked with that rare naivety that young people are not afraid to question their ignorance  Prince Andrew answered with a smile and a shaking of his head Kutuzov is Suvorovs right hand the best Russian general  But what about being an aide They can send you cant they  Of course the Adjutants influence is insignificant Prince Andrew answered but we must begin And my father wanted it I will ask Kutuzov to give me a detachment And then well see  It must be strange for you to fight Napoleon Pierre said as if assuming that Prince Andrei would have to fight if not martial arts the closest thing to Napoleon as soon as he came to the war Prince Andrew thoughtfully smiled at his thoughts turning a graceful feminine gesture wedding ring on an unnamed fingerThere was a ladys dress in the next room As if having woken up Prince Andrew shaken up and his face took the same expression as it had in Anna Pavlovnas living room Pierre lowered his legs from the sofa The Princess came in She was already wearing another homemade but equally elegant and fresh dress Prince Andrew stood up politely moving her chair but in his face while he was doing it expressed such boredom that the princess would be offended if she was able to watch  Why I often think why didnt Anette marry as always in French How stupid of you all to not marry her gentlemen If youll excuse me you dont understand women Pierre and Prince Andrei involuntarily glanced over and remained silent But neither glance nor silence did not embarrass the Princess at all She kept talking the same way  What an arguing man you are Monsieur Pierre she turned to a young man  What an arguing man you are Monsieur Pierre she repeated sitting in a big chair by the fireplace in a hurry and trouble as always Folding her little hands over her waistline she must have been silent going to listen Her face took that special serious expression in which her eyes looked inside her an expression only in pregnant women  I argue everything with your husband I dont understand why he wants to go to war said Pierre without any shyness so ordinary in a young mans relationship to a young woman addressing the Princess The Princess has met Apparently Pierres words affected her alive  Oh Im saying the same thing  she said with her secular smile  I dont understand I dont understand why men cant live without war Why dont we women want nothing we dont need anything Well there you are be the judge I tell him everything here hes an aide at his uncles the most brilliant position Everybody knows him so well so valued The other day at Apraksins I heard a lady ask Is this the famous Prince Andrew Honestly She laughed Hes so accepted everywhere He can very easily be an adjutant wing You know the king of the third day had a very gracious talk with him Anette and I talked it would be very easy to arrange What do you think Pierre looked at Prince Andrei and noticing that the conversation did not like his friend did not answer anything  When are you going  he asked  Oh dont tell me about this departure I dont want to hear about it said the Princess in a whimsical playful tone that she spoke to Hippolyte in the living room and that wasnt so obviously going to the family circle where Pierre was a member  Today when I thought I should break off all this expensive relationship And then you know Andrei She blinked her husband considerably  Im afraid Im afraid  she whispered shaking her back Her husband looked at her as if he had been surprised to see that someone other than him and Pierre had been in the room but he turned to the princess with cold courtesy  What are you afraid of Lisa I dont understand he said  Thats how all men are selfish all all selfish God knows why he abandons me locks me in the village alone because of his whims  With father and sister dont forget Prince Andrew said quietly  alone anyway without my friends And he wants me not to fight moose  Her tone was already grumpy her sponge was rising giving her face not a joyful but a beastly squirrelly expression She was silent as if she had found it indecent to speak in front of Pierre about her future birth whereas that was the essence of the matter  Still I dont understand what youre afraid of Prince Andrew spoke slowly keeping an eye on his wife The Princess blushed and waved desperately  No Andrei Im saying youve changed so so much  Your doctor tells you to lie down early Prince Andrei said You should go to bed The Princess said nothing and suddenly the short one with the whiskers of the sponge shuddered Prince Andrew stood up and shaking his shoulders walked through the room Pierre surprised and naively looked through his glasses at the other and moved as if he wanted to get up or think again  What do I care what Monsieur Pierre said Suddenly the little princess said and her pretty face suddenly blossomed into a tearful ugly face  Ive been meaning to tell you Andrei why did you change your mind so much What have I done to you Youre going to the army you dont feel sorry for me You dont feel sorry for me Why  Lisa  Only Prince Andrew said but in this word there was both a request and a threat and most importantly the assurance that she would repent of her own words but she continued hurriedly  Youre treating me like Im hurting or a child I can see everything Were you like this six months ago  Lisa I beg you to stop Prince Andrei said even more expressively Pierre more and more excited during this conversation got up and approached the Princess He seemed unable to bear the sight of tears and himself was ready to cry  Calm down Princess You think so because I assure you I have experienced why because No Im sorry theres someone elses No calm down Goodbye excuse me And he was gonna leave in a bow Prince Andrew stopped him by the hand  No wait Pierre The Princess is so kind she wont deny me the pleasure of spending the evening with you  No he only thinks of himself the princess spoke without holding back angry tears Lisa  said dry Prince Andrew raising the tone to a degree that shows that patience is exhausted Suddenly the angry squirrelly expression of the beautiful face of the princess was replaced by an attractive and compassionate expression of fear she looked at her husband with her beautiful eyes and her face seemed to be that timid and confessed expression of a dog quickly but weakly waving his tail down  Oh my God oh my God  the princess spoke and having picked up the fold of her dress with one hand went to her husband and kissed him on the brown forehead  Good night Lisa said Prince Andrew standing up and kissing her hand as courteously as an outsiderXI My friends were silent Neither one started talking Pierre looked at Prince Andrew Prince Andrew rubbed his forehead with his little pen  Lets go to dinner he said with a sigh getting up and heading for the door They entered the elegantly newly decorated dining room Everything from napkins to silver faience and crystal bore the special imprint of novelty and elegance that is found in the young couples household In the middle of the dinner Prince Andrei leaned over and as a man who has long had something in his heart and suddenly dared to speak out with an expression of nervous irritation in which Pierre had never seen his friend began to speak  Never never marry my friend heres my advice dont get married until you tell yourself youve done all you can and until you stop loving the woman youve chosen until you see her clearly or youre wrong cruelly and irreparably Marry an old man to nowhere or all that is good and tall in you will be lost Everything will be wasted on little things Yes yes yes Dont look at me with such surprise If you expect something ahead of you youll feel like its over for you at every turn everythings closed except the living room where youll be standing on the same board as the court footman and idiot No way He waved his hand with energy Pierre took off his glasses which changed his face showing even more kindness and looked at a friend in surprise  My wife Prince Andrei continued is a beautiful woman She is one of those rare women with whom you can be dead for your honor but my God whatever I give now to not be married Im telling you this alone and first because I love you Prince Andrew saying this was even less like the gentleman who lay falling apart in the chairs of Anna Pavlovna and through his teeth squinting said the French phrases His dry brownish face all trembled with nervous revival of every muscle his eyes in which before seemed extinguished fire of life now shone radiant bright shine It was obvious that the more lifeless he seemed in ordinary time the more energetic he was in those moments of almost painful irritation  You dont understand why Im saying this he continued  Because its a whole life story You say Buonaparte and his career he said even though Pierre didnt talk about Buonaparte  You say Buonaparte but Buonaparte graduated from artillery school and came out when there was war and the road to glory was open to everyone Pierre looked at his friend apparently forward ready to agree with everything he said  Buonaparte went out and found the place he was supposed to take right away And who were his friends Who was Josephine Bogarne My five years of living out of the Pagina Corps  living rooms balls love affairs idleness Im going to war now to the greatest war Ive ever had and I dont know anything and Im no good I am kind and sarcastic and Anna Pavlovna listens to me and I forgot that I knew Ive just started reading now but its all out of touch And without knowledge of military history mathematics fortification there can be no military man And this stupid society without which my wife can not live and these women I was successful in the light The most sophisticated women threw themselves at my neck And if you could know what all these exquisite women are and women in general My father is right He says nature isnt wise because she couldnt invent the means to spread the human race beyond a woman Selfishness vanity stupidity nothing in everything thats what women are when they show up as they are Look at them in the light they seem to have something and nothing nothing nothing Yes dont marry my soul dont marry said Prince Andrew and shook his head so much as if everything he said was such a truth that no one could doubt  Im laughing Pierre said that you you think youre incapable your life is ruined You have everything everything ahead of you And you He didnt say  you but his tone already showed how much he appreciates his friend and how much he expects from him in the future In the best friendly and simple relationship flattery or praise is necessary as a grease is necessary for the wheels to drive  I am a finished man said Prince Andrew but from the high and proudly raised beautiful head and the bright shine of his eyes you could see how little he believed in what he was saying  What shall we say about me Let us talk about you he said silently and smiling at his comforting thoughts This smile reflected on Pierres face at the same moment What about me  said Pierre opening his mouth to a carefree cheerful smile What am I Im an illegitimate son And suddenly for the first time all night he blushed red It was obvious that he made a big effort to say it  No name no fortune And well the right But he didnt say  is right  Im free for now and I feel good I just dont know what to start I wanted to give you some serious advice Prince Andrew looked at him with kind eyes But in his eyes friendly affectionate still expressed consciousness of his superiority  I care about you especially because youre one living person In the middle of our world Youre good Pick whatever you want it doesnt matter Youll be good everywhere but one thing Stop going to those Kuragins lead this life So it doesnt suit you all this rebellion and hussarism and all that  You know what Pierre said like he had a sudden happy thought seriously Ive been thinking about it for a long time With this life I can neither decide nor think about anything I have a headache no money He called me today Im not going  Give me your word honestly youre not gonna drive  Honestly  Look  Of courseXII It was  am when Pierre left his friend It was the night of June the night of St Petersburg the crazy night Pierre sat in a cavalry carriage with the intention of going home But the closer he arrived the more he felt unable to fall asleep on that night which was more like an evening or a morning You could see from the empty streets far away He could see Prince Andrews lively beautiful face he could hear his words  not about his relationship with his wife it did not occupy Pierre  but his words about the war and the future that could await his friend Pierre loved and worshipped his friend so much that he could not let Prince Andrei as soon as he wanted to not everyone recognized him as a wonderful and great man which is characteristic of command not obey Pierre could not imagine that anybody Kutuzov for example was sick of the spirit to give orders to such a man apparently born for the first role in everything as he imagined Prince Andrew He imagined his friend in front of the troops on a white horse with a short and strong speech in his mouth imagined his bravery his success his heroism and everything that most young people imagine for themselves Pierre remembered that he had promised to pay a small card debt to Anatole who was supposed to have an ordinary gambling society tonight  He went to Kuragin he said to the coachman thinking only of where to spend the rest of the night and completely forgetting the word given to Prince Andrew not to go to Kuragin Driving up to the porch of a large house near the Horse Guards barracks where Prince Anatol Kuragin lived he remembered his promise but immediately as it happens with people called wimpy He so eagerly wanted to come in and take another look at this so familiar and tired of his dissolute life and it involuntarily occurred to him that this word did not mean anything moreover even before Prince Andrew he also gave Anatol the word to bring the debt Finally he thought that all these honest words were such conditional things which had no definite meaning especially if he thought that maybe tomorrow either he would die or something so extraordinary would happen to him that it would be neither honest nor dishonest He climbed the lighted porch the stairs and entered the open door There was no one in the magnificent front empty bottles lying in the corner a mountain of curved maps cloaks and overshoes the smell of wine the distant speaking and shouting were heard Apparently the game and dinner are over but the guests have not yet left Pierre threw his cape down and entered the first room where a statue of a fulllength racehorse stood in the middle From the third room one could hear more clearly the chatter and familiar laughter and screams of six or eight people He went into the third room where the rest of the dinner was still standing Eight young men all without suits and mostly in military raids crowded near the open window and all together shouted incomprehensible words in Russian and French  I got a hundred for Chaplin  screaming alone  Look dont support  another one was screaming  Im for Dolokhov  shouted third  Take it apart Kuragin  One spirit or its lost  the fourth shouted  Jacob get the bottle Jacob  shouted the master himself tall handsome statuesque standing in the middle of the crowd Wait gentlemen There he is Pierre  Ah Peter Petrusha Peter the Great  Peters fat  screamed from all sides bypassing him On all red and with red spots the young faces expressed joy at the sight of Pierre who taking off his glasses and rubbing them looked at all this crowd  I dont get it What is it  he said smiling generously  Wait hes not drunk Give me the bottle said Anatole and took the glass from the table and went to Pierre  Drink first Pierre silently began to drink glass by glass watching out for drunken guests who again gathered at the window talking about something he did not understand He drank one glass in volley Anatole poured him another with a considerable view Pierre drank humbly though slower than the first Anatole poured a third Pierre drank this one too though he stopped twice to catch his breath Anatole stood by seriously looking at the glass the bottle and Pierre with his beautiful big eyes alternately Anatole was handsome tall full white blushing his chest was so high that his head was thrown back which gave him a proud look He had a beautiful fresh mouth thick brown hair black eyes and a general expression of strength health and kindness of fresh youth But his beautiful eyes with wonderful right black eyebrows as if they had been made not so much to look at as to be looked at They seemed incapable of changing the expression That he was drunk could only be seen from his red face but even more so from his unnaturally convex breasts and the open eyes Even though he was drunk and the upper part of his mighty body was covered only by the shirt open on his chest the light scent of perfume and soap that merged around him with the smell of the wine hed drunk and the carefully nourished hair of his hair in the morning by the graceful purity of the puffy hands and the finest underwear by this whiteness and smooth tenderness of the skin  and in his present state he was seen as an aristocrat in the sense of having become accustomed since childhood to careful and luxurious care for his special  Well drink it all  He said seriously serving the last glass to Pierre  No I dont said Pierre stuck on half a glass Well what is it  and now he thinks hes entitled to participate in a common cause  Drink it all   Anatole repeated with his eyes wide open and raised his white naked glass to his elbow with his hand He looked like a man doing an important job because he was using all his energy to keep the glass straight and say exactly what he wanted to say  I said I dont want to Pierre answered putting on his glasses and walking away What are you yelling about  he asked the crowd at the window Anatol stood up thought gave the glass to the servant and having smiled a little with his beautiful mouth came to the window too On Fridays Anatol Kuragin hosted everyone played dined and then spent most of the night away from home On that day the game of Pharaoh was long and big Anatol lost a little and as he had no passion for the game but played by habit he soon fell behind One rich man a lifegussar lost a lot and one Semenov officer Dolokhov beat everyone After the game they sat down very late for dinner A very serious Englishman posing as a traveler said that he believed according to reports that the Russians drink much more than he found it in practice He said that only champagne is drunk in Russia and that if he drinks rum he offers a bet that he will drink more than all those present Dolokhov the officer who won the most that evening said that just a bottle of rum should not be bet on and that he volunteered to drink it without taking it away from his mouth and sitting on the third floor window with his legs down The Englishman offered a wager Anatol took the bet as Dolokhov that is that Dolokhov would drink a bottle of rum on the window The minute Pierre came in were you lackeys The window on the third floor was high enough for a man who fell from it to kill himself to death Drunk and friendly faces on all sides told Pierre what was going on as if assuming that Pierre would know the case some kind of special importance Dolokhov was an officer of the Guards Infantry Regiment medium height muscular as if knocked down all over with wide and full breasts extremely curly and with light blue eyes He was twentyfive years old He did not wear a mustache like all infantry officers and his mouth the most striking feature of his face was all visible This mouth was extremely pleasant despite the fact that he almost never smiled The lines of this mouth were remarkably finely curved In the middle the upper lip energetically descended upon the strong lower lip a sharp wedge in the corners formed a kind of two smile one on each side and all together combined with a straight somewhat insolent but fiery and clever look the impression was that passing by this face it was impossible not to notice it and ask who the owner of such a beautiful and strange face was The women liked Dolokhov and he was frankly convinced that there are no perfect women Dolokhov was a young man with a good family name but not rich however he lived a luxurious life and constantly played He almost always won but no one even in his absence dared to ascribe his constant success to anything other than happiness a bright head and an unshakable willpower In his soul everyone who played with him assumed in him a cheater although he did not dare to say so Now that he had made his strange bet the drunken society took a particularly lively part in his intention And precisely because those who knew him knew that what he had said would be done Pierre knew it also because he only said hello to Dolokhov and did not try to object to his intention The rest of the society consisted of three officers an Englishman who was seen in St Petersburg in a variety of societies one Muscovite player a married fat man who was much older than all but was on you with all this youth A bottle of rum was brought the frame which did not allow to sit on the outer slope of the window was broken by two lackeys in pins and caftans apparently in a hurry and timid from the advice and screams of the surrounding lords Anatol with his breasts convex without changing his expression without bypassing and asking to stand aside squeezed the crowd at the window with his strong body came to the frame and wrapping both white hands with a surtuk lying on the sofa hit the glass and punctured them  Here we go Your Ladyship said the footman but youll get in the way and cut the pens  Go fool huh  Anatol talked took up the frame bars and started pulling A few hands also took up the case they pulled and the frame jumped out of the window with a crackle so the pulling almost fell  Everybody out or theyll think Im holding on said Dolokhov  Listen Anatole Pierre said  Do you understand The Englishman is bragging huh  Okay Pierre said looking at Dolokhov with a sinking heart as he took a bottle of rum in his hands and approached the window where the sky shone and the morning and evening dawns merged Dolokhov having rolled up his shirt sleeves for something with a bottle of rum in his hand cleverly jumped onto the window  Listen  he shouted as he stood on the window sill and turned to the room Everyones quiet  I bet you fifty imperials I bet you fifty imperials You want a hundred  he added addressing the Englishman  No fifty said the Englishman Okay fifty imperials that Ill drink a bottle of rum all without taking it from my mouth Ill drink it sitting outside the window on this spot he bent over and showed a sloping wall protrusion outside the window and holding on to nothing So  Very good said the Englishman Anatol turned to the Englishman and taking him by the button of the tailcoat and looking at him from above the Englishman was small began to interpret in English what was already clear to everyone  Wait  Dolokhov screamed banging a bottle on the window to pay attention Wait Kuragin listen If anyone does the same I pay  imperials Do you understand The Englishman nodded his head not letting him know whether or not he intends to accept this new bet Anatol did not let the Englishman go and despite the fact that he nodded to let him know that he understood everything Anatol translated Dolokhovs words into English A young skinny boy a lifegussar who had lost that evening climbed up on the window came out and looked down  Ooh  he talked while looking out the window at the sidewalk rock  Hold it right there  Dolokhov screamed and yanked off the window of an officer who confused by spurs awkwardly jumped into the room Having put the bottle on the window sill so that it would be convenient to reach it Dolokhov carefully and quietly went into the window With his legs down and both hands stretched out into the edges of the window he tried it on sat down let go of his hands moved to the right and left and took out the bottle Anatol brought two candles and put them on the window sill though it was already very light Dolokhovs back in a white shirt and his curly head were lit on both sides Everyone gathered at the window The Englishman stood in front Pierre smiled and said nothing An old Muscovite with a frightened and angry face suddenly moved forward and wanted to grab Dolokhov by his shirt  Gentlemen this is nonsense hell kill himself to death he said Anatol stopped him  Dont touch youll scare him hell kill himself  What then  Dolokhov turned around recovering and regaining his arms His face was neither pale nor red but cold and evil  If anybody else comes to me he said seldom missing words through clenched and thin lips Im gonna bring that one down here And its so slippery you roll down and theres grunting Well Saying well he turned again let go of his hands took the bottle and brought it to his mouth threw his head back and threw his free hand up for the overweight One of the lackeys who had begun to pick up the glass stopped in a bent position keeping his eyes on the window and back of Dolokhov Anatol stood upright his eyes shining The Englishman protruding his lips forward looked at the side The old Muscovite ran into the corner of the room and lay down on the sofa facing the wall Who stood with his mouth wide open who with his hands raised Pierre closed his face and a weak smile forgotten remained on his face though it now expressed terror and fear Everyone was silent Pierre took his hands away from his eyes Dolokhov sat in the same position only his head bent back so that the curly hair of the back of his head touched the collar of his shirt and his hand with the bottle rose higher and higher shuddering and making an effort The bottle must have emptied itself and at the same time it rose up bending its head What took you so long Pierre thought It seemed to him that it had been over half an hour Suddenly Dolokhov moved his back and his hand trembled nervously that shudder was enough to move the whole body sitting on a sloping slope He moved the whole body trembling even more making an effort his arms and head One hand went up to grab the window sill but it went down again Pierre closed his eyes again and told himself that he would never open them again Suddenly he felt that everything around him was moving He took a look Dolokhov stood on the window sill his face was pale and cheerful abandon ability able abortion
